# To-do app 

Small to-do app for taking your notes.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gokhansisman/todoapp.git
cd todoapp > npm install > npm start ( will run automatically backend & frontend same time, check on localhost:3000)
```
if you want only see frontend,
cd todoapp > cd frontend > npm install > npm start ( will run only frontend on localhost:3000) 

## Notes

```python
* I create my own API for to-do application with MongoDB. (used express)
* I used React.js & Redux in frontend.
* I spent 12 hours on this project.
* I didnt use localStorage because there is a one line like that " Any user who has access to link can perform any
operation. There will only be one to-do list. " so, I thought there will be one list for everyone.
```
